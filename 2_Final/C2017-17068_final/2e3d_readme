## 2-(e) ##

Quadrature method is more efficient.
Quadrature method has smaller difference while MC and quad method took similar time.
(In my result, simp and trep has difference in scale of 1e-5~6 | MC has error in scale of 1e-2)

Indeed, on integral of 2 dimensional function, 
total error of quadrature is O(N^-1), while MC has error in order O(N^-0.5).

## 3-(d) ##

3c is more efficient.
Indeed, quadrature method(For 1D exact formula) has error in order O(N^-2), while MC method(For 4D) has error in order O(N^-0.5).

Result show above argument seem plausible.
MC method has variance in scale 1e-3~4,
where trepizoidal,simpsons method has diffrence in order 1e-6~14
